Nice to see a drop return to the volatility in #BTCâ€¦or maybe the real story is the increased volatility in the Nasdaq and S&P 500? Either way, as the markets continue to look for cryptocurrencies to act as an alternative hedge investment strategy will find this deviation a welcome change. 

So what else happened in 2018 to BTC?
