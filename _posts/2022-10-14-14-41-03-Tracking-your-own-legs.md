Things aren’t always what they seem when it comes to product demos. **Perhaps this was part of the Apple magic when products were announced for immediate availability**. Nowdays more and more product launches (Apple included) involve pre-launch orders and splashy, highly glamorized video of the expected product. 

Of course this isn’t new and human nature tends to oversell and undeliver. We all engage it, intentionally or unintentionally. You only have to look as far as Kickstarter where individuals “sell” their ideas to an audience they hope will believe in their vision. The temptation to “fake” that vision to appear already created is incredibly high. Temptingly high. So high that Kickstarter began to implement a rule restricting videos involving a ‘finished product’. 

Here we find that even the largest of brands is not above bending the truth and misleading an audience with a deceitful, false impression. 

I guess the takeaway is a bit of sadness for the true state of today’s tech. And an eagerness to see the future evolve. 

Oh, and shame on Meta.
