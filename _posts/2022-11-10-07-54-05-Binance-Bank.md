Binance demonstrates their desire to be open and transparent in their funds held in cold wallets. And much like their maligned counterpart (Tether), we find fairly well-done bookkeeping. While it remains to be verified by 3rd party auditors and we donâ€™t yet see the associated Merkle Tree proofs (does everyone know what this means? If not - let me know and we can dig deep on the tech!

I think this is good for the industry, regardless of the cause.
