Iâ€™ve been considering this heavily myself and so I was appreciative to hear one of the individuals I respect from a technical analysis and market perspective echo similar sentiments surrounding Solana. 

Raoul Pal has also articulated an additional point that I had failed to properly identify regarding the target market and the focus of the Solana chain/network. 

Solana = the consumer chain. Interesting concept and one I can see having true, redeeming value. However, the biggest obstacle maybe the deeply integrated FTX relationship.
