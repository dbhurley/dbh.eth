I guess it was inevitable after seeing all the press that Visa has been getting recently for their various crypto initiatives. Today we hear the other behemoth speak up. 

Mastercard’s *Executive Vice President of Digital Assets and Blockchain Products & Digital Partnerships* (guaranteed that job title does not fit on a standard business card) shared their view on what the future of finance looks like with crypto. 

He outlines 5 key areas that need to be focused on and offers some work being done in those areas. 

While I love seeing existing companies embrace the future and begin to focus their attention on how to be a relevant part of that future…I look forward to the future of fintech and our global financial infrastructure. 

Who knows, maybe we’re going to all be sporting Mastercard NFT’s in our metaverse wallets.
