The Apollo Moon mission not only demonstrated the feasibility of human spaceflight but also spurred advances in a number of key technologies. The Apollo program was designed to send humans to the moon and back within a decade of President Kennedy’s 1961 speech announcing the goal. In order to achieve this, NASA had to develop a number of new technologies, including powerful rockets, a spacecraft capable of carrying astronauts beyond Earth’s orbit, and a landing craft that could safely deliver them to the lunar surface. 


### The heart of the mission
The Saturn V rocket, which propelled Apollo astronauts to the moon, was one of the most powerful machines ever built. It stood taller than a 20-story building and generated as much thrust as 85 jet engines. The Saturn V was so big and complex that it required the development of new manufacturing techniques and test procedures. NASA’s Apollo spacecraft consisted of three parts: the Command Module (CM), which housed the astronauts; the Service Module (SM), which contained fuel and other supplies; and the Lunar Module (LM), which would carry two astronauts down to the moon’s surface. 


### Technical Overview of Saturn V
The CM was designed to re-enter Earth’s atmosphere at high speeds, while the SM protected it during launch and provided propulsion in space. The LM had its own engine for landing on the moon. The Apollo Lunar Module was an incredibly complex machine, with more than 2 million parts. It had to be lightweight yet strong enough to withstand impact upon landing. The LM also had to be able to operate in both vacuum and atmospheric conditions and protect its occupants from extreme temperatures swings and radiation exposure. 

### Mission accomplished
After years of development, testing, and delays, NASA finally launched Apollo 11 on July 16th, 1969. On July 20th, Neil Armstrong became first person to walk on another world. The success of Apollo 11 proved that humans could travel beyond Earth orbit and opened up a new era of exploration. In addition to its historical significance, the Apollo Moon mission also had a profound impact on technology. 

### Modern space influences
Many of the technologies developed for Apollo have found their way into everyday life on Earth. For example, satellite communication systems like those used to relay TV images from space are now commonplace; GPS navigation systems use similar technology to pinpoint your location anywhere on Earth; memory foam mattresses were originally developed by NASA engineers to improve astronaut comfort levels; water purification systems used aboard Apollo spacecraft are now used in hospitals around the world; cordless power tools were first used byApollo astronauts during their EVA missions; even scratch-resistant lenses for eyeglasses were inspired by technology developed for spacesuits!

As web3 materializes we should be constantly looking for and isolating tech use cases which extend far beyond the blockchain.
