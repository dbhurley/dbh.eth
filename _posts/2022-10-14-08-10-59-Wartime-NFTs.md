I can’t help but consider history when reading articles like this. I don’t think anyone would disagree with me that NFT artwork can play an important role in preserving cultural artifacts, especially during wartime. 

And of course I think of the Nazi regime in Germany, and how they began a process of cultural cleansing, which included destroying or confiscating works of art that they deemed to be degenerate. Many of these works were lost forever. Only a few were able to be saved thanks to the efforts of individuals who smuggled them out of the country. 

NFT artwork can help to preserve these cultural artifacts by providing a digital copy that can be shared with the world. 

And perhaps even more importantly then the ascribed monetary value to the artwork, the real and true value is in allowing people to learn about the history and culture of a country, even if the physical artifacts have been destroyed.
