Okay, I know we’re supposed to get all excited every time we have a new mainstream platform incorporating NFT and crypto technologies into their product. 

But I think it’s important to keep everything in perspective and the best way to make decisions is with as much information as possible. This sometimes leads to a splash of cold water on undue crypto enthusiasm. 

Yes, 3m wallets have been created, let’s not rush to call them “new users to crypto” and perhaps even more importantly, most of this rollout from Reddit did not heavily market the underlying crypto technology and the concept of buying and trading avatars was the market angle (which is very different from a non-fungible token marketing campaign). 

Either way, I’m glad to see it and think it’s just another proof point to add to the list. And I am reminded to read headlines with an open and inquiring mind.
