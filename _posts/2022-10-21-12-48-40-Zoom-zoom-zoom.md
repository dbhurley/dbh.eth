I just read this article, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/19/technology/personaltech/quest-pro-review-metaverse.html">I Tried the $1,500 Quest Pro and Saw the Best of the Metaverse</a>, and I am struck with the truth found in the author’s opinion and my agreement with her sentiment. However, I find one critical and extremely realistic benefit that’s been ignored. The video conference call. Most meetings last how long? That’s right, under 2 hours.

And let’s be honest, the internet has changed the way we interact with each other and the world around us. We can now connect with people from all over the globe in ways that were once impossible. The next logical step in this evolution is the metaverse: a virtual world that is immersive, interactive, and user-generated. Of course there are a ton of reasons why meetings and events will be held in metaverse spaces in the future. Let’s look at a couple of the more obvious ones: First, it allows for a far more immersive and engaging experience for attendees. They can explore the space, meet new people, and participate in activities in ways that are not possible in the physical world. (Hello conferences!) Second, metaverse spaces are not constrained by geography. Anyone from anywhere in the world can attend a meeting or event in a metaverse space. This opens up new opportunities for collaboration and networking. Now if we could only solve timezone problems. Third, metaverse spaces offer a level of customization and flexibility that is not possible with physical spaces. Event organizers can create custom environments to match their brand or theme. They can also control who has access to the space and what they can do there. Finally,metaverse spaces offer a unique opportunity to build community online. Attendees can connect with each other before, during, and after the event through social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter. They can also join discussion forums or chat rooms to continue the conversation after the event is over.

We may never find ourselves living in a metaverse 24/7; but one day soon, you may be laughing at the talking head Zoom call you’re about to jump on.
