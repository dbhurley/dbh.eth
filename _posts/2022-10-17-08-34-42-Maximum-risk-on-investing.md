In a somewhat unsurprising article, but perhaps informative viewpoint to be reinforced, a recent study released studying global wealth managers has identified the risk appetite for cryptocurrencies by high net-worth individuals. 

In spite of the high volatility of crypto assets, most of these investors were seeking maximum returns and were willing to accept maximum risk in crypto investments as a result. This makes sense as the crypto holding for many of these investors is an incredibly small fraction of their overall investing strategy and net worth. 

The takeway for banks (and governments?) - Itâ€™s not all about the ETF.
