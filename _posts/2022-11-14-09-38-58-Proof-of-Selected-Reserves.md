Nice to see self-regulation begin to enter the crypto space, even if it comes on the backs of catastrophic failure. While this should not be the end of this process it is a welcome step in the right direction. 

These exchanges posting liabilities as well may still be obfuscating true liability, so keep in mind, just because you see something online…doesn’t mean it’s true. 

Unless of course, you’re seeking a date with a French model. https://youtu.be/3DZbSlkFoSU
