Volatility runs rampant and there are quite a few opinions on the role these fluxes in the market play. Here’s a few of my favorites.

>"Volatility is the friend of the investor seeking value."
-Warren Buffett

>”Volatility is the enemy of the investor seeking returns."
-Ray Dalio

*Which one do you side with?*
