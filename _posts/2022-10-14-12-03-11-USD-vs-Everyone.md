The concept of a digital Asian currency is nothing new, and in fact, China has been leading the way in testing a centralized stablecoin. 

In this report from Bejiing we hear of a broader effort being investigated to spread this digital token across multiple fiat currencies (13 in fact!). And all of this in an effort to reduce reliance on the USD. 

The real question is - when do we see a one world currency? **Or have we already discovered it and not grown the courage to name it directly.**
