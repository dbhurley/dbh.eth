An ETF by another name? This article suggests that major reputable investment firms (Morgan Stanely, etc) are still heavily investing in crypto-based asset classes. Currently ETPs are the “flavor of the month” which represents a vehicle by which individuals can gain access to crypto risk.

Of course it’s only a matter of time I believe before we see an even broader push for a Bitcoin (and others) ETF. 

### Roadblock
Perhaps the reason for this current roadblock is the fear of the coming *flood* of new assets seeking similar ETF status. 

### Bottom line
Simply put - the wave continues to swell and I believe it’s only a matter of time before we see some major shifts happen.
