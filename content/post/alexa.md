I read a fascinating news article yesterday which highlighted something incredibly interesting about the use of Alexa in the real world. Curious? Here are a few stats:

* Amazon has sold more than **50 million Alexa-enabled devices**.
* Only **2%** of those people have made a purchase through Alexa.
* And of the 2%, **more than 90%** never used it again for shopping.

Wow, that's some terribly rough statistics for the voice-activated shopping future of the world Amazon suggested.
