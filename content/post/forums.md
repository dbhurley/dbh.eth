Let it be known, here and now, there are few things I like less in the world of software than forums. The message boards from the 90’s turned into the forums of the ’00’s and the fallback failure of the ’10’s. Search engines have made forums remain relevant simply for SEO benefits and purposes and for some misconstrued belief that there is untold wealth in the knowledge shared through the forum softwares of the world. Rather, I suggest these are nothing more than a gigantic waste of time and effort by moderators and knowledgeable humans as they wage meaningless war against the bots and the spam for the sake of a page rank. Highly curated, useful information can be shared and contributed to by the whole in many more profitable ways than a forum. We should be replacing them, not killing ourselves working in them.
