Bravery is an interesting trait in a leader. Many times in the past people would associate bravery with fearlessness. Thankfully we're seeing a shift in thinking in recent years in this regard.

There is a growing recognition that bravery is the acknowledgement and appropriate response to fear. But what does bravery look like? I'm glad you asked.

Bravery in leadership can be exhibited in a number of different ways. **Here are a few of the most common ways a great leader exhibits bravery.**

1. Great leaders exhibit bravery by standing up for what they believe regardless of the consequences.
2. Great leaders recognize bravery means accepting damaging things and dealing with them instead of running from them.
3. Great leaders demonstrate bravery through consistency. That's an odd one right? But it ties in with the first, bravery means continually standing up for what they believe in. Day in, day out.Great leaders show bravery in the face of fear. They take their fears and put them in their proper place. They don't ignore them, they don't pretend they are not real, and they certainly don't run from them. Instead, great leaders put fear where it belongs. Acknowledged and brought under control.
