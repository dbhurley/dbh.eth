Every day is a fresh start, I get that. But I think Monday holds a slightly elevated level of this ingrained human inclination towards optimism. Monday is _(for most)_ the start of a new week. A chance to start fresh. A new opportunity to become more of the aspirational self they desire to be. Whatever happened last week is done, it's behind you, it's gone. Today, right now, this is the _first_ day of an exciting new chapter.

**How will you spend it?**
