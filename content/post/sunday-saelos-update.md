Since it’s my weekend project and since today is Sunday I feel it’s an appropriate time to publish a quick update on Saelos. I’ve done the unthinkable. In the world of software development and releases some might say I’ve done the unimaginable. I announced a release date. That’s right, in case you missed my previous blog post ([catch up here](http://dbhurley.com/introducing-saelos-a-personal-project/)), I have announced a date when I’d be releasing my passion project [**Saelos**](https://saelos.org).

I’m not repeating that date here, if you’re curious about when it is…go [check out the previous post](http://dbhurley.com/introducing-saelos-a-personal-project/). Let’s just say under my current level of stress and the number of hours left in my weekend it’s going to be a bit of a hard deadline to hit. But I’m committed. And just in case announcing something like an actual date of release isn’t stressful enough - **the response I’ve received so far has been insane**. Far more than I anticipated.

I’m a stats kind of guy, and as a programmer the numbers and equations are kind of a thing for me. I love to see and find patterns and since my little side project is just getting started I figured I’d set the stage right by sharing various stats as I go and as I get closer to a release. Because there’s something else that defines me; besides just being into the numbers and the patterns. I am _open_. I believe in open source to my core and that same openness pervades other areas of my life too. I hope you find the inside view refreshing and informative. Let’s get rid of black boxes.

Okay, so here’s some information coming at you: Since I published the blog article on March 14 _(roughly 11 days ago)_ there have been 472 individuals that have submitted the form requesting more information. We can also take a quick look at geographic information and see 35 different countries are represented by those known contacts with the majority of those originating in the United States. The website has tracked more than 5,000 unique visitors. And that’s just a couple of the numbers.

> In case you're curious: I collect these types of details (and much more) using **Mautic**, an incredible [open source marketing automation platform](https://www.mautic.org).

In regards to the blog article, it has exploded into the top 10 most visited pages of all time on my website ([interested in the first?](http://dbhurley.com/open-source-project-update-top-secret/)) . And this is after only 11 days of being published. I find this exciting and intimidating at the same time (no, not being trying to be cliché). It’s awesome because it means there’s a real interest and a real concern. It’s terrifying because I put a date on it! What was I thinking? And why on earth am I wasting my weekend hours writing a blog post instead of working on it?

I guess because I want you to be as excited as I am about what’s coming and I want you to know what’s going on behind-the-scenes. The numbers are fascinating and exciting. The interest is very real and I want you to be a part of the entire journey, start to finish. All in all, things are progressing nicely and I can’t wait to share more with you. If you do want to know more, [check out the splash page](https://saelos.org), throw in your email address, and get notified when something new is shared. (You can also sign up on my blog here on the left to be notified).

Now, I’ve got to get back into things. I’ll do my best to share a bit more with you in the days ahead. But don’t sit around waiting for me! Sign up to let me know you want me to reach out and then go out and get something done (or enjoy your relaxing Sunday)! We’ll be talking again soon.
