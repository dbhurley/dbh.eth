The early pre-dawn morning air is cool, just the faintest nip against your skin. The sun just starting to peak over the distant hills. Warm against your face you feel the rays soak into your soul. This is truly the best time of the day. Alone with the world, alone with your thoughts. What a time to recharge, regenerate, and renew your spirit. This incredible peaceful morning is yours. This day ahead is yours. This lifeâ€¦.is yours. Take the early morning run, feel the cares like the miles slip away. Clear your head and run. Run into the sun. Run to the light. Run. Today is your day. Do something courageous today. Do something daring.
