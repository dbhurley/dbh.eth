Some of you may be very familiar with the term. I have used it a lot in the past but I think for those that might not have heard the term let me share why I like the idea of rubber-ducking so much.

First, gotta start by understanding the term. **It's a verb and involves the general idea of talking to an inanimate object** (_e.g. a rubber duck_). This is not because you're crazy (though others might think so); instead this is a chance for you to verbalize thoughts, hear them out loud, and process through information in a different way. This is often done for the purpose of bettering your thinking on a topic or improving your points and how you share them.

Second, I can't tell you the number of times i use this technique **in a single day.** There's immense value in getting your ideas out of your own head (even if it's only to that empty chair sitting next to you).

Lastly, there's an even better version of rubber-ducking. This involves bouncing your ideas off another person. **But there are some strings attached to this version.** Your person has to be "your person" meaning they know they aren't there to criticize or chastise your thinking. In fact, sometimes the recognize their purpose is merely to listen. As the idea sharer you have to feel safe to say whatever you are thinking no matter how ineloquent or scattered those thoughts might be. _Your person has to be the right person to be able to do this._ If you have someone like this you are **blessed**.

When you get to the end of your verbal stream of consciousness there's the opportunity for your person to ask questions. Not challenge you (remember you need to feel safe). Instead, they may ask for more explanation or a repeat of certain thoughts. This is why having "a person" is better than a "rubber duck".

Regardless of the method, the outcome from engaging in this activity is highly beneficial and I recommend you add it to your thought process daily!
