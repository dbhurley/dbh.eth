Great leaders hold those around them to higher standards. Not only holding others to high standards but they also lead by example. **Great leaders expect themselves to perform at peak performance as well.** Sometimes this leads to burnout, sometimes this leads to breakdown. Strong leaders are able to handle

these self-imposed pressures and find ways to balance them in their own lives as well as in those who follow them.  A _good_ leader understands the values of holding high standards and implements them in life. A _great_ leader makes them fun and an attainable, achievable goal which can be conquered daily for a greater sense of self fulfillment.

* Great leaders set high standards for themselves first and then for others who follow
* Great leaders recognizes by setting high standards they attract instead of detract the right people
* Great leaders make high standards achievable and repeatable
