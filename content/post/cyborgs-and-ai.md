I am almost embarrassed to write this due to the lateness with which I am apparently reading this particular blog post, but for those that have beat me to it I beg for your patience while I get a bit excited in sharing my personal discoveries. Okay, with that being said let me dig in and get a bit more specific.

I recently stumbled across this article, [Neuralink and the Brain’s Magical Future - Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html) and it's done wonderful things for putting real words to some of the thoughts I have been entertaining regarding the future of AI and humanity. If you have a free 30 minutes (_maybe an hour or two_) then I can think of very few things more worth the investment of your time. Take a deep dive into this line of thinking and expand your horizons.

I can tell you that a few of the concepts here touch on topics that I have personally been very excited about and have begun discussing with those that work closest to me. I agree with the observations concerning the direction of our current technology and I also agree with the concept of how we successfully navigate the perceived dangers of AI. Bottom line: **An integrated AI is where I place my hopes and intents for the future.** And although there are a couple of areas in the post where I take a different line of thinking from those shared in this article there are many others where I agree. A fully integrated tertiary layer that improves upon our “output” will revolutionize our future. External vs Internal supplemental AI seems a moot point that society will need to reconcile in time.

If you’d like to read what I’m reading and are curious what my thoughts are about where we go from here, then this article gives some great insights to get you started. Read it and let's talk. Read it and challenge your own thinking. Read it and challenge mine. As I shared on my short form post, _Opinions_, this ability to form, express and differ in those opinions is what will improve us all.
