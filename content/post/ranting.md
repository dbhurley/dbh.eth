It's easy to think that sometimes we just have to let out our thoughts and everything will be okay. It's also easy to think that there's no harm in ranting. Don't be fooled. The words you say are important, they can affect people. Even if you simply need to vent some frustration, find a safe place (or a safe person) with whom you can do this. If you just start unloading on whomever is close by you risk damaging a relationship, or at the very least, their opinion of you. Don't foolishly share your spur-of-the-moment, off-the-cuff heated feelings. Even when ranting, think before you speak.
