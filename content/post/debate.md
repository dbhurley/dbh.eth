I have never been a fan of debates or challenges/confrontations. It’s not easy for me to hold them, whether I feel strongly about something or not. It’s just always been an area where I have preferred for everyone to just “get along”. But as I’ve grown in my own knowledge and understanding I begin to recognize the immense value in these types of debates and heated talks. It challenges me. It challenges me to back up what I’m thinking and feeling and to examine more importantly **why** I feel the way I do and think the way I do. It makes me better. It makes the other person better. And so I’ve come to appreciate the tremendously positive aspects of discussion. _Although I admit I still get knots in my stomach._ It’s worth the challenge. Growth is good.
