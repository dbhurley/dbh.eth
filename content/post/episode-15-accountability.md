"Passing the buck" originated from a ritual practiced during card games. Card players used to place a marker, called a "buck," in front of the person who was the dealer. That marker was passed to the next player along with the responsibility of dealing. Eventually "passing the buck" became synonymous with passing on responsibility.

**President Harry S. Truman had a sign on his desk that read: “The Buck Stops Here.”** It meant he accepted accountability for all the decisions of his administration. Truman’s stand exists in organizations today but, unfortunately, as the exception rather than the rule.

* Accountability means honesty
* Accountability means saying you're sorry
* Accountability means seeking advice
