Here we are on another weekend, and it sure feels like they come fast and furious these days. I don’t know if it’s just me or if time is actually speeding up. (_And anyone that dares to suggest this relativity has anything to do with my age will be summarily disavowed._) Regardless, it’s Sunday and as they have come to be affectionately known, it’s a **Saelos Sunday**.

## Statistics Focus

There are so many things I’d like to share with you but in an effort to draw your attention to one particular and important statistic I’m going to focus on only one slide. In this way we can share in the excitement of the meaningfulness of these statistics.

> Before you get all stressed out because I’ve use the word “statistic” more than once in the previous paragraph, let me calm you down by sharing a picture with you (_pictures make everything better_).

{{< figure src="/images/2018/10/saelos_stability_downloads.png" >}}

## Saelos Downloads

Now, I confess I said I would be focusing in on “only one slide”, but I’ve been a bit sneaky — if you’ll notice this slide actually shares **two** very important facts in a single slide. Let’s first look at the downloads. It’s quite exciting to see the numbers climbing so significantly with each release. This means the world is beginning to discover Saelos: a new open source CRM.

As you can see from the picture, the Beta 3 release had only 32 downloads, Beta 4 had 86, and then Beta 5 scored an _overwhelming_ 395 downloads! Now, we are currently in the middle of Beta 6 and we’re on track to see more downloads than any other previous release with 306 downloads.

## Saelos Stability

But the stability of Saelos is the second critical factor that is displayed in the slide above. You’ll notice that with each release the time period before the next release has grown. Whenever there is a lengthening time between releases it usually means one of two things, either the software is not being developed at the same speed as previously, **or** the bugs being uncovered are becoming fewer and fewer.

I am happy to report in Saelos the number of issues that have been uncovered has been shrinking with each subsequent release. This shrinkage is quite common in the development of a product, particularly one proceeding through a beta process. As a result this slows down the number of releases and also demonstrates an exciting fact: **Saelos is getting close to being released as a Release Candidate.**

> In case you’re curious or need a refresher on process. A software product following proper versioning goes through multiple beta releases (_determined by the number of issues uncovered in each release_) , then a release candidate, then a stable release.

## Coming Soon

As I mentioned, based on these statistics Saelos is getting close to a Release Candidate. This is an exciting moment. If you are currently using Saelos then this should be a welcome announcement — a stable open source CRM ready to be implemented in your production environment is coming soon.

If you’re wondering what it will take for this to happen then I’m glad you’re thinking about it! Our community needs issues reported when there are [bugs found](https://github.com/saelos/saelos/issues) (_this can be submitted on GitHub_); fixes for those issues submitted as [new pull requests](https://github.com/saelos/saelos/pulls) (_also on GitHub_); and any last minute feature requests (_with code attached!_) to be included in a stable release.

## Keeping Up-To-Date

Lastly as you prepare for this upcoming release you should make sure you’re keeping up-to-date with the announcements being made. There are several ways you can do this and I believe in though our community is still quite young we do a great job communicating on a variety of channels. Pick your preference: You can [subscribe to the Saelos email](https://m.saelos.org/saelos-newsletter-signup), [join the Slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/saelos/shared_invite/enQtMzQ3MTA2MTc4OTMzLWNlYjU1MGU2YmZhY2E4Y2Q0MmQyMjkwN2JmNjRiMjcyMGYyZjgwMGYxZGI4ZWMyOTA5MGUxNWI2Y2I5Y2U3YjU), or [register your account on the website](https://www.saelos.org/s/welcome/custom_pages/container/view?id=1) (_truthfully speaking it wouldn’t hurt anything to be around on all three_).

## One More Thing

I know it sounds a bit forced but forgive my headline nostalgia for a moment. There is one last thing I’d like to share in this Saelos Sunday update. Even though our community is very fresh we have already seen incredible volunteers contributing in a wide variety of ways. Sometimes I just have to sit back and contemplate the awesomeness of those individuals who believe in my vision, who personally agree with what I’m trying to accomplish and are willing to join forces with me in reaching for these lofty goals.

I’ve spoken before about the power of the “[first follower](http://dbhurley.com/first-follower-ftw/)” and this is a perfect example of how relevant and important these early adopters, advocates, and strong believers are to our success. This week in particular I’d like to draw special attention to one special **Saelos Superstar**.

## Saelos Superstar

**Luiz Eduardo** has contributed countless hours to improving Saelos [through code](https://github.com/luizeof), [through distributions](https://hub.docker.com/r/saelos/saelos/~/dockerfile/), and [through community growth](https://www.facebook.com/groups/saeloscrm.brasil/). His dedication to spreading the Saelos Story far and wide is evident in the vast and widespread work he has undertaken on behalf of our community. I hope you’ll join me in thanking him for his hard work and dedication to Saelos. And I trust his example will encourage you to find ways you can also become more involved in the Saelos community. (_Not sure where to start? Drop me a line and I’ll be happy to give you some ideas._)
