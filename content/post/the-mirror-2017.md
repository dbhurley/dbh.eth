Well recently [I wrote about my New Year’s Resolutions](http://dbhurley.com/new-years-resolutions-2018/) and I admit my post was a bit of tongue-in-cheek and felt it only fair to share something with a bit more substance. I figured the best way to do this was to share something meaningful which I spent a significant amount of time writing. _This was meant for internal use only but in the interest of openness and transparency I’m going to share with the community._

Every end of year provides an opportunity to reflect back on the previous 12 months and identify the successes and the stumbles that occurred. A good look at oneself is hard but extremely helpful. Knowledge is power and if we have a good understanding of what we truly know we can be more powerful. Honestly there’s few things worse than to be “in the dark” about something and if we don’t know what happened in Mautic or what others are doing then we are completely clueless.

Below is a document I created that will help you understand every aspect of Mautic. If you’re involved in Mautic then this document will give you a great review over what all has been done in the past year. If you’re not yet a part of this incredible community then maybe this deep look at every aspect of Mautic will help you understand why Mautic so special. And even better this may give you some ideas on how you might get involved in the Mautic community.

I will probably comment about various aspects of this doc in future blog posts but for starters I’m merely going to share the doc. Enjoy the reading!
