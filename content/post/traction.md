It seems anywhere you go in the startup world the term traction is one that always gathers attention. Everyone wants to know how popular you are. In a way it reminds me of high school all over again, only now the stakes are a bit higher. Now it’s not the eye of that special someone you’re trying to catch, it’s the eye of the special VC firm. Or maybe it’s the eye of the other users in the room. Very few people want to be the first to talk about something new and definitely no one wants to be the last. Traction. I’ve been able to witness this subtle evaluation firsthand with our relatively young open source community, Mautic. And I’m excited to share with you some preliminary results.

## Not Stealth

Mautic was launched in a public beta on January 10, 2015. We didn’t have a lot of fanfare and we had very little publicity surrounding the launch. Those start-ups eager to appear bigger and greater than they are would call this a “stealth” launch. At Mautic we called it something a bit less glamorous, we call it “shoestring marketing”. We believe in the grassroots approach that if you like something you’ll tell your friends about it. We know Mautic is amazing and as we share it with those around us they soon find it to be amazing too. When your product is good (maybe even great) people don’t hesitate to share it with their friends.

We visited only a few (two I believe) events locally and shared it with everyone we could. Other than those events we have relied on organic growth. Partly because we believe in the grass roots effort and partly because quite honestly we couldn’t afford a lot more. Hey, this is open source, free software!

## Major Milestone

Well, it’s now been approximately 3 weeks, 21 days since that quiet initial launch. I am incredibly excited and pleased to share where we are today. In only 3 very short weeks we have seen hundreds and hundreds of individuals, businesses, organizations, and companies experience the freedom of Mautic. I am thrilled to announce that in these few short weeks we have quickly surpassed the 1,000th Mautic install. That’s right, over 1,000 organizations from around the world have begun their new marketing adventure. They have found the future of marketing automation. They have set themselves and their businesses free.

I’ve always been a huge fan of Buffer and their policies on open transparent practices. They have proven the power of transparency and I hope to see the Mautic community follow in those ways. I believe as Mautic grows it will continue to be a leader not only in open source software but also in open source practices and a leading example as a transparent community. So here are a few more stats for you to enjoy!

## Worldwide

Mautic has been discovered in 172 different countries. Google says there are 196 countries total. That means there are only 24 countries that have not yet found Mautic. Only 24 in the entire world! Let’s reach them. Do you know someone in Greenland?

## Translated

Mautic has been fully translated into 5 languages with a total of 10 languages currently in progress. This is an incredible testimony to the global approach of Mautic and the power of open source software. Mautic is not for the United States only. Mautic is for everyone.

## Summary

I think our traction is pretty amazing. But even more amazing is the response we’ve gotten. People are excited. The community is growing, overflowing with excited people eager to be a part of something new and something revolutionary. Mautic gives everyone equal tools for success. If you haven’t looked at it I would recommend you take a glance. I’d hate for you to be one of the last ones!
