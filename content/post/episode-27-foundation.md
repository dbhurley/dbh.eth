Great leaders recognize the importance of a strong foundation. They understand this foundation is a basis by which they think, live, and work. Without a strong foundation when the stress of the job comes they will stumble, fall, or give up. What does a strong foundation mean?

What does it look like? Here are 3 principles I believe you can find in the foundation of every great leader:

1. Great leaders have built a strong network of trusted friends, and allies.
2. Great leaders have identified ways to handle stress before they are experiencing it.
3. Great leaders have created a realistic plan for what they expect to achieve.
