Leaders have to do things that others may not have to do, and may not ever see. Leaders have to maintain a level of commitment to an idea, a plan, a process, even a person beyond what many would even consider doing.

* Leaders commit to the plan (but recognize change is inevitable and important)
* Leaders commit to the people (but again recognize not every fit is the right fit)
* Leaders commit to the process (trusting the gut is important but sometimes that's indigestion)

> If you are a leader, the true measure of your success is not getting people to work. It's not getting people to work hard. It is getting people to work hard together. That takes commitment."- **John C. Maxwell**
