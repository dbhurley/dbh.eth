If you haven't been keeping up with my recent thoughts that's okay. But you have some catching up to do (_good thing the current culture supports and encourages reading time!_) I'd recommend reading through this series, [Exploring the Progression of Modern Software](https://dbhurley.com/exploring-the-progression-of-modern-software-part-1/), and then follow up with my recent thought, Survival of the Fittest. This should get you caught up on the current line of thought that we're going to continue pursuing with this series, **The Trust Era**.

### Nature + Technology

We've been thinking a good bit about the concept of nature as it relates to technology, and returning readers will remember we previously considered the field of biomimetics _(the interdisciplinary study of nature + technology)._ It's always nice when a thought we entertain actually exists in life already and even better when we can apply the principles to a new idea. This is what I'd like to do with you now.

In this series which I'm calling, The Trust Era, I'd like to ponder with you a surfeit of thoughts around this concept of biomimetics. As I organized my own ideas I realized I was looking at this topic almost as if it was a gem, a precious cut stone with a multi-faceted appearance. This simple allegory should make it easier for us to form a full and complete picture about the Trust Era. With this framework understood let's dive in to our first facet: Availability.

> **A CX Case Study**In order to make this entire thought experiment more "real" it's important to apply these principles to a specific example/use case. As "Customer Experience", CX, and all things "experience"-related are such buzzwords these days, we will consider this field as the specific example we'll use.

## Availability

I would suggest, as we consider software's relationship to nature, the first area which we can clearly correlate relates to the concept of the **availability**. Now in our case study area of _CX availability_ takes a variety of forms: multiple channels for communication (chat, email, social, phone numbers, and more...). Allow me to explain. The importance of availability as it relates to customer experience can't be underestimated. Without this essential element the customer experience will suffer, the relationship will fail to grow and the company will begin to stagnate. The ability of a customer to connect with a company at any point in time through a wide range of channels offers the optimum in availability and promotes both customer health and ultimately the customer experience.

In many ways, this mimics the effects of the **sun** in nature.  Light is an essential element necessary for the process of photosynthesis to occur within a plant cell. Without sunlight the plant cannot grow. This light must be readily accessible for the plant to truly grow and thrive. **Thus availability is a critical facet of this next era of modern software.**

**Side Note:** Keep in mind, as we continue to ponder these facets, we are only making application to a single area of software (CX) and as a result we should constantly also be extrapolating potential key hypothesis and observations which can then be applied to other software areas. I'll leave this as an exercise for you to think through on your own.
