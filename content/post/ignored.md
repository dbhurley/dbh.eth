In case you missed the recent news I feel its worth mentioning and drawing your attention to it again. **This headline shouldn't surprise you.** In fact, I read it and felt vindicated in my constant and growing borderline paranoia. This is a problem _but a solution is coming_. I am so incredibly fascinated by this topic and can't help but wonder how many times we have to hear about things like this before as a society we decide enough is enough.

It is my opinion we _will_ see a shift in thinking once an alternative is made available and most importantly made **easy to use**. This is why I get excited...but you'll have to wait to hear more about that in the future.

_I admit I've been a bit quiet lately because I've been heads-down actually writing code! It's been a real personal indulgence lately to dig into the world of programming again and I've lost a bit of my blogging (and reading) time because of this increase in code-creating...but **I think I am on to something and I can't wait to share it with you.**_

In the meantime, [read this article](https://apnews.com/828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb/AP-Exclusive:-Google-tracks-your-movements,-like-it-or-not). Add this one to the ever-growing list of similar posts that are being shared with greater frequency each and every day...and ask yourself...is _this_ the tipping point for you? Aren't you ready for a change?

> Google wants to know where you go so badly that it records your movements even when you explicitly tell it not to.
