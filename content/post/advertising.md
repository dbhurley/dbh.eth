How do you know when advertising has gone too far? This is the constant question which continually comes up whether it's in real-life B2B marketing or even in the digital world of Hollywood blockbusters. For example, I'm reminded of that scene from the recent movie, Ready Player One.

> “We have determined that we’ll be able to fill 80% of the user’s display with advertising before inducing seizures.”

We all laugh at a line like the above when its used in the movies. And I admit, I laughed as well. I mean what a humorous and ridiculously preposterous line...right? **Right?!**

But then I find myself staring at a screen like the following and I wonder, _who's laughing now?_

_Can you find the content?_
