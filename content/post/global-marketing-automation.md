When we talk about global marketing automation and the need for a product which can meet the diverse needs of a world market one of the first priorities becomes languages. [I've written about this before](http://dbhurley.com/languages/) but recent news has made this a good time to revisit the topic. More often than not people tend to forget that there are other languages spoken in the world. It’s just human nature to become comfortable and focus on your local environment. This is especially noticeable in the Western world _(aka the United States)_. But this is close-minded and a narrow focus on the task to accomplish.

Marketing automation has traditionally been one of the largest offenders of this narrow view of the world. **Case in point**: some of the most well-known existing marketing software companies are proud (and actually brag) on the fact they provide their software in 5 languages. Five.

Mautic is an open source marketing automation platform where the focus from the very first day has been on a global environment and the vision for a product available to everyone in every language. This community-first approach has lead to some incredible milestones being reached at insane speeds. How incredible? Let’s look at some numbers.

**More than 253 collaborators have joined the Mautic translations team.** Together these engaged volunteers have actively been **translating Mautic into 24 languages**. With more than 47 languages started. That’s amazing! (24 languages is 500% more translated than the other marketing platforms.) And **the Mautic community has accomplished this in under 10 months**. That’s not a typo; in less than a year this community has come together and built a robust platform available in a way unlike anything before. Local and familiar.

But this is not the end of the story. Even Mautic has a long way to go. Our community has some great momentum but this is not the time to sit back and relax. Because this is the bigger picture:

And so, even though Mautic dominates the marketing landscape there are still thousands of languages yet to go. And as we have done so far we will continue to do, pressing on, empowering people around the world to use cutting edge marketing software in their native language. Because that’s what open source and community means. This is the power of our community and this is the power of Mautic.
