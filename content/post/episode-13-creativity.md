Leaders recognize creativity isn't always a "lone inventor" practice. Genius can come from many contributions as opposed to only one.

* Leaders empower others to identify good ideas
* Leaders encourage contribution and idea sharing (tolerant to opposition)
* Leaders understand the value of scaling their creativity

**Creativity is not a mystical talent but a carefully cultivated tool. Wielded by the best leaders in the world to accomplish incredible things.**
