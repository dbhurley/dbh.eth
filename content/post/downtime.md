Nobody should work non-stop. Everyone needs some downtime and a break. It’s important to remember this simple fact. It’s also more important to remember that not everyone requires the same thing. Some people find respite and a chance to recharge by reading a good book, others by watching a movie, some by playing video games, and even others by socializing with friends. And just like the mechanism is unique to an individual so also is the length of time. Ten minutes for one person may be the equivalent of 1 hour for someone else. But **everyone** needs downtime.Make sure you avoid burnout by identifying what works best for you. Finally, once that time is passed, get back to it, renewed and recharged.
