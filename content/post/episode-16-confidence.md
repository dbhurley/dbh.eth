The greatest basketball player of all time, Michael Jordan once said,

> â€œI've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed."

**This level of confidence is a requirement of a good leader.** Even with a statement like the above we still see confidence exhibited in his attitude and his game play. Good confidence is not arrogance. Here are three defining qualities of confidence:

* Confidence acknowledges failures
* Confidence is persistent
* Confidence requires practice
