This is a _bonus_ Saelos mid-week post, but that's because **I need your help** and I need it _urgently_! I'm doing a quick feedback loop about CRM platforms and I realized there's no better audience than my personal network of friends and followers. I need your ideas, your thoughts, and maybe most importantly...your complaints!

That's right, this is **a free pass** to gripe, complain, and whine about the shortcomings, faults, and flaws of your current software. You know your friends and co-workers usually don't want to hear about the problems you're having (_we all have plenty of our own_). But today is your day, and this moment is your moment. Unload on me. Share your ideas, thoughts, and problems. I'm listening!

Okay, okay, that's all you get. No more moaning and groaning, get back to your day and keep your chin-up, your feedback has been heard and you may soon have answers to your problems!
