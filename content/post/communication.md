Limitless possibilities for societal progression occur when people are given the opportunity to collaborate and combine their excess, untapped, personal knowledge. Just as a cord of many strands is not easily broken; the combined strength of individual strands of human experience and previously unused personal talents form an unbreakable mesh upon which the world's commerce can be upheld. This collaboration and combination never occurs in a vacuum. Only through an open philosophical approach to life and fulfillment of basic human needs can this social good be realized. Communication is the vehicle to drive this open revolution forward.  Through clear, concise, collaborative dialog each person is allowed the freedom to articulate their value and gain from the shared values of others.
