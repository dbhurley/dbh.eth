It’s our nature as humans to see everything from our own point of view. We’re instinctively protective of our own selves. Physically, emotionally, mentally, in every way we are wired to “put ourselves first”. This works great on the survival basis. But in relationship management and relationship building. This is quite possibly the most detrimental thing we can do. The next time you’re talking to someone. Don’t think about yourself. Put yourself in their shoes; imagine how they see the situation. Grow your empathy. It’s not easy, but the reward of a deep and lasting relationship are worth the effort.
