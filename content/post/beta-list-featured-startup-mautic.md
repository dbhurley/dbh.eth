So there’s an awesome website, if you’ve never heard of it you need to check it out. It’s called [Beta List](http://betalist.com). Beta List gives you just what it sounds like, a list of awesome new software platforms that are currently in beta. You can get a quick overview of what the app does and view a screenshot or two before visiting the site to sign-up for the beta.

#### No, not an advertisement!

Why am I talking about this website? I’ll tell you why. Yesterday I was notified, much to my delight, that our young, new community [Mautic has been added to the list and featured](http://betalist.com/startups/mautic). It may not seem like a big deal to you, but it’s pretty awesome to be placed on the list among other great up-and-coming beta apps. We’re incredibly excited to share Mautic with new people and introduce others to the future of marketing automation. **Free and open source marketing automation.**

#### Check us out!

If you have time I’d encourage you to stop by our listing, check us out, but also look around at some of the other amazing beta opportunities listed on the website. Oh, and I apologize in advance because you may get lost in the excitement of looking around and lose track of time.
