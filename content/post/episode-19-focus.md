Great leaders understand the importance of focus. The ability to set aside distractions and pursue a single goal. There's a couple important side topics with this idea of focus. First, it doesn't mean blindly following a vision with no listening to other's or outside advice. Nor does it mean an unswerving approach to problem solving. There are always times when a zig here or a zag there becomes critical for success. Focus involves a concentrated effort to exert self-control and will-power over innate desires to wander or be distracted by flashy, momentary interests.
