2017 is drawing to a close and it’s been a whirlwind of a year. There’s been so much going on in the Mautic universe it can be a bit overwhelming. Whether you’ve been around for the entire ride, or just joined us I have no doubt that you may have a few questions about things.

As you may have begun to notice I’ve been ramping up my efforts on sharing information. One of my focuses as we close out this year and start the next year involves how to empower more people in our amazing Mautic community. To that end I have been working on the best way to share information, organize my thoughts, and help get everyone on the same page in terms of Mautic: where we are, where we’ve been, and possibly most importantly - where we are going. I’ve shared several posts recently on my blog ([here](http://dbhurley.com/standardizing-github-for-product-management/), [here](http://dbhurley.com/creating-the-mautic-credit-system/), and [here](http://dbhurley.com/recognizing-mautic-code-contributors/)) which give a few insights but I believe there are even more ways I can improve. Because I think there are probably still questions outstanding that haven’t been answered yet.

So, in order to help with that I am preparing to do something for the first time in Mautic history. I am excited to announce our first ever **AMA** (ask me anything). This will be an opportunity for you to ask your questions directly and **hopefully** get immediate answers. There’s general guidelines for the session and of course any deep technical questions or bugs you just want solved are not really the purpose of this time. **To put it bluntly I won’t be “live fixing” anyone’s website. 🙂**

However, questions about how Mautic should be used, ways to get involved, questions about the roadmap, our community future, leadership structure, GitHub projects etc…these are all welcome topics and I will do my best to give you good, clear, concise answers. And I give you my word, if I don’t have an answer - I’ll be honest enough to tell you I don't know and point you to a resource that might be able to help.

> The goal of this AMA is to ensure our global community, and you as an individual, feel confident in what we’re doing and also where we’re going. I hope this will be a fun, enjoyable and informative session where we can all learn and improve.

And lastly, if all goes well I hope we will hold more of these in the future. I’m not going to dig into specifics about what to expect (_Remember this is our first one, we’re going to be learning as we go_). But here’s what you need to know now:

**What**: Mautic’s First Ever AMA**Where**: Mautic’s Slack Channel - # ama**When**: December 21, 2017**Time**: 10:00AM EST ([The World Clock Meeting Planner - Details](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingdetails.html?year=2017&month=12&day=21&hour=15&min=0&sec=0&p1=43))**What To Bring**: Your questions!

See you there!
