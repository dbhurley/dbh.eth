There's something oddly comforting about directions. A sense of confirmation that you're doing the right thing. And this gives a feeling of confidence and empowerment to the directions-follower. Good directions offer guidance and support when needed without making the follower feel like they are being terribly restricted and still able to maintain a sense of freedom. Oftentimes good directions are almost naturally intuitive or make the follower feel as though they may have already known the right way.

But bad directions? Or missing directions? Few things are worse for the user experience. Regardless of whether the path to take _should be_ intuitive. The label of intuitive design should be made by the follower...not the one in charge of leading the way or offering the direction. **Directions should never be ignored.** The result will always be a less than ideal user experience.
