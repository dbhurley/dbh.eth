Recently I had the great privilege to travel and speak at the 3rd annual CMS Africa Summit. I was asked to deliver two keynotes and the second one focused on the idea of growing a community. The session title: **Building Powerful Community Networks**, was given to me by the event organizers but I believe it was quite insightful on their part.

Below are my slides from my session. While usually I offer a more extensive write-up to associate with a slideshare like this I believe these slides speak fairly well for themselves. I trust you’ll look through these slides and you’ll be able to easily see the message I shared.

**I believe deeply in the power of communities** and I love researching how to scale community growth. I hope you’ll enjoy glancing through this deck and exploring what I see is the secret to growth hacking.
