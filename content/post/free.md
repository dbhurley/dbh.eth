There's a common misconception in the world that anything which doesn't require a fiat currency as payment for goods is somehow considered to be "free". However, there are many other ways in which a business can "charge" for something. The beauty of this correlation exists when a business is able to capitalize on this feeling or sentiment that they are getting something for _free_ when in reality they are simply paying a price in a different "currency".

I'm reminded of this in particular today due to the unique and highly successful **free marketing** campaign held by the restaurant, Chick-Fil-A. If you live in an area where this chain operates then you probably are very aware what today is. For the rest of us, today is colloquially known as **Cow Appreciation Day**. üêÑ In other words, should you choose to assemble a few bovine accoutrement (_dress like a cow_) and plod into one of their establishments you will be herded towards rewarded with a _free_ meal.

The allure of _free_ at the low, low cost of your personal dignity and a few cow spots dotting your personage. üòâ Bravo to Chick-Fil-A for a brilliant and highly successful marketing campaign. They have identified a marketing campaign which maximizes their brand visibility while also meeting the _free_ mentality of their customers.
