Sometimes building brand affinity is as simple as recognizing which company rules can be bent for the sake of the customer. The resulting goodwill sentiment and brand loyalty can yield far far more than any rewards program. This personalizes the brand and makes them feel approachable. Then a company will be perceived as a cool friend... instead of another greedy corporation intent on making a profit at the expense of the customer. The customer doesn't maintain a strict guarded profile mistrusting every action and a real relationship can be established.
