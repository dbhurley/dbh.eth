**“Done is the engine of more."**I loved this quote when I first read it. I think a lot of the time we focus on the concept of shipping something and being “done”. But we have the wrong concept for what the word means. Done is not complete and finished. Done is not the end. Done is not the goal. Done is the **engine**. Done is the first step on the path to success. Done is the motivator and the driving force to encourage the next step. Done empowers. Done enables. Done amplifies feelings of success to enable greater accomplishments.
