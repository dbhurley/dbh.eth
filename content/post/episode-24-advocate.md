Great leaders care about others. They don't focus only on solving their own problems or finding the solutions their business alone needs. Great leaders seek to raise other people up and draw attention to their needs and situations as well. Great leaders find ways to help solve their problems and issues. Sometimes this is through their business, but many times this is as simple as advocating for others and raising awareness to their needs. A great leader is able to recognize the stage and audience they have and then use that audience to serve a greater good. Leaders advocate for others.

**Taylor Swift is a great example of this.** She's always been a strong a advocate for others in the music business. She uses her notoriety and fame to raise awareness and advocate for artists and musicians everywhere. When Apple made a strong move to offer a service which would harm many new, undiscovered, and struggling musicians she wrote the following:

> Thankfully I am on my fifth album and can support myself, my band, crew, and entire management team by playing live shows. This is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success. This is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt. This is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create, just like the innovators and creators at Apple are pioneering in their field…but will not get paid for a quarter of a year’s worth of plays on his or her songs.

She went on: "These are not the complaints of a spoiled, petulant child. These are the echoed sentiments of every artist, writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect Apple so much."

**Good leaders realize they have an opportunity to help others... great leaders recognize it's their responsibility to do so.**
