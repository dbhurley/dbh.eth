There's a very fine line between celebrating and boasting. I can't remember where I first saw the discussion, but the topic centered around one of the loudest mouths in history, the unmatched, unforgettable Mohammad Ali.

I've [written about him on my blog](http://dbhurley.com/the-greatest-at-personal-branding/) and there are many, many positive lessons we can draw from his example (confidence, strength, courage, self-worth just to name a few). But one aspect of Mohammad Ali which I would doubt anyone could contradict was his celebrating. In fact, I would venture so far as to suggest his celebrating was actually something a bit more than simple excitement over success. He was boastful. He bragged on himself. This brings me to my 4 minute thought for today. Great leaders celebrate. Great leaders don't boast. What's the difference? I'm glad you asked (_or at least thought the question..._)

1. Great leaders share successes and celebrate for the right reasons. **WHY** am I sharing this information. Is it simply to make myself look good? _(That's boasting)_
2. Great leaders consider how they share success, is there a better way to share (_Filter_).
3. Great leaders recognize celebrating success should be focused on the right object. _(What's the object and why do others care - does it benefit them in some way?)_
