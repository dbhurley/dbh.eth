I've written about it before and I've talked about it before, but I don't think I've ever done so in relationship to being a good leader. So that's our lightning fast podcast topic for today! Are you busy, busy, busy...doing nothing?

Great leaders make the most of their time. Of course just like anyone else they lose time on things and they don't always make the right judgement call on a particular task or project. But as the great quotable Deadpool says 4 or 5 moments are all that define a hero. In this case though great leaders make the most of their time, most of the time.

Great leaders realize that just being busy is not the same as being productive. There's an old quote by Mary O'Connor I've shared before on my blog which says,

> “It's not so much how busy you are, but why you are busy. The bee is praised. The mosquito is swatted.”

This the fundamental truth we heard in the song at the beginning and in this quote. How you are busy is what matters. Great leaders are busy doing things which result in meaningful outcomes. They are busy working on those tasks which directly contribute to their success. Great leaders do things which make their ideas become realities. They realize they are working towards a goal and every second counts. So the question for you is simple....Are you busy, busy, busy...doing nothing?
