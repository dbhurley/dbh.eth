Today (Thurs, Oct 13, 2022) we get another CPI (core price index) report.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I heard an interesting blurb on a podcast yesterday suggesting that until the general public has completely lost interest in the CPI reports, the FOMC, and anything else coming from Mr. JP … the recession will continue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the point of this article and my associated thought relates entirely to the supposed safe hedge Bitcoin was supposed to represent. What once began as a clear and safe alternative to other US stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate, and everything else has ended up behaving exactly like “<em>everything else</em>”</p>

<p>Is crypto the safe alternative or yet another US asset class? What’s your thought</p>
