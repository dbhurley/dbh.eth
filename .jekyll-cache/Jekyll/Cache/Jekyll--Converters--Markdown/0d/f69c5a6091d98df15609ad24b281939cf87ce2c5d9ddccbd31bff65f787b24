Well well well if it isnâ€™t good oleâ€™ Wally World weighing in once again on the value of crypto. Although this news headline should come as no surprise for those of us who have witnessed the continuing explorations of the largest big box store in the world.</p>

<p>Walmart has continually pushed cryptocurrency concepts, primarily through their explorations into the metaverse and potentially NFTs.</p>

<p>This latest announcement seems to suggest the retailer is now also considering cryptocurrencies for alternate payment methods.</p>

<p>So, does crypto need the Walmarts of the world? Or the Mastercards?</p>
