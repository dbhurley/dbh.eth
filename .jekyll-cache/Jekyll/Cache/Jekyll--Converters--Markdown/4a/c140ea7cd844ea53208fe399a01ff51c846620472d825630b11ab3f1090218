The concept of a digital Asian currency is nothing new, and in fact, China has been leading the way in testing a centralized stablecoin.</p>

<p>In this report from Bejiing we hear of a broader effort being investigated to spread this digital token across multiple fiat currencies (13 in fact!). And all of this in an effort to reduce reliance on the USD.</p>

<p>The real question is - when do we see a one world currency? <strong>Or have we already discovered it and not grown the courage to name it directly.</strong></p>
