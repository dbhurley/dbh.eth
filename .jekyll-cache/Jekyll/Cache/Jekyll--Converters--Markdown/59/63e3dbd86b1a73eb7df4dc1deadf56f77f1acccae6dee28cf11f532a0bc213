If I were to create a token for an open source community I think there’s a few compelling ways to go about it.  However, in order to give a concrete example to work through I’m going to reference one of my recent most favorite open source projects, Stable Diffusion. If you don’t know about Stable Diffusion I recommend reading more about what they are doing in democratizing AI generative art (even that is mouthful which doesn’t adequately describe what they are undertaking…and accomplishing!).</p>
