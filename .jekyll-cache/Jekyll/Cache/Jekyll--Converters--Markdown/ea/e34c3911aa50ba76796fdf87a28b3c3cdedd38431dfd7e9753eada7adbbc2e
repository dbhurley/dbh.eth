Just read this article, https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/19/technology/personaltech/quest-pro-review-metaverse.html and am struck with the truth found in the authorâ€™s opinion and my agreement with her sentiment. <em>However</em>, I find one critical and extremely realistic benefit thatâ€™s been ignored. The video conference call. Most meetings last how long? Thatâ€™s right, under 2 hours.</p>
