Optimistic rollups are a type of rollup that uses an on-chain validator to commit data to the mainchain. This validator is responsible for validating the data that is being committed, and if the data is invalid, the validator can be punished. Zk-starks are a type of rollup that uses a zk-SNARK to verify the data that is being committed. This verification is done off-chain, and if the data is invalid, the zk-SNARK will not verify it.</p>
