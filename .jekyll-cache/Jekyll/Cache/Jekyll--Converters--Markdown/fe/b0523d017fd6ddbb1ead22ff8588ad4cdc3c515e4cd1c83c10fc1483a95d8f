<p>We all recall the heavy push for migration from the dominant cloud server market to Google Cloud. We’ve all seen the leadership changes and the various initiatives seeking a foothold in the space. Now, in what can only be considered a careful evaluation or risk vs reward we find Google Cloud engaging in the “cutting edge”, ultra-trendy cryptocurrency space.</p>

<p>Now perhaps this is the big toe of the tech behemoth before a full blown dive in the the crypto pool. But considering the quarterly revenue targets for Google Cloud combined with the relatively small percentage of the revenue pie represented by Google Cloud, my cynical eye sees a balanced barter.</p>

<p>Oh, and I’m certainly not complaining. Come on in Google, the water feels great.</p>
