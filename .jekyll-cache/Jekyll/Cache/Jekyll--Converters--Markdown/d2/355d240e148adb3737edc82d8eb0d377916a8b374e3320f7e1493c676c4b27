<p>The internet is a wealth of information. You can find out how to do just about anything with a few clicks. But, this can also be a bad thing. If youâ€™re not careful, you can get bogged down in the noise and miss the signals that are actually important.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s important to learn how to filter out the noise and focus on the signal. Otherwise, youâ€™ll never get anything done. And, even worse, you might start applying the wrong information to your own life!</p>

<p>Here are a few tips for avoiding information overload:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Donâ€™t try to do everything at once. Pick one thing that you want to focus on and ignore everything else until youâ€™ve finished it.</li>
  <li>Be selective about the sources of information that you use. Thereâ€™s a lot of garbage out there masquerading as truth. Stick to reliable sources that you know and trust.</li>
  <li>Donâ€™t believe everything you read (or watch, or listen to). Take everything with a grain of salt and use your own judgment before making any decisions based on what youâ€™ve consumed..</li>
  <li>Take breaks. Give yourself some time to process everything youâ€™ve taken in. Our brains can only handle so much information at a time.</li>
  <li>Lastly, apply what youâ€™ve learned. The whole point of consuming information is to learn from it and change your behavior for the better. Otherwise, itâ€™s all just a waste of time.</li>
</ol>

<p>Learning these simple habits and applying them to your information consumption will ultimately help you come out on top of the data mountain.</p>
