There is evidence that the U.S. streaming market is maturing and slowing down, which suggests that overall TV revenue is likely near a peak. Even after media conglomerates work through the current period of high startup investment in their streaming businesses, steady-state streaming margins are likely to be much lower than traditional TV margins. As such, these companies will need to focus more on optimization rather than subscriber growth.</p>

<p>If these streaming services don’t figure out how to change their strategies accordingly, we might see the slow painful death of yet another media service.</p>

<p><em>TL;DR It’s not all about the number of subscribers.</em></p>
