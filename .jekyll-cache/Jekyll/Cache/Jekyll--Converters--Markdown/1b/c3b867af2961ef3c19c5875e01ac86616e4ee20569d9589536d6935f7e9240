Things arenâ€™t always what they seem when it comes to product demos. <strong>Perhaps this was part of the Apple magic when products were announced for immediate availability</strong>. Nowdays more and more product launches (Apple included) involve pre-launch orders and splashy, highly glamorized video of the expected product.</p>

<p>Of course this isnâ€™t new and human nature tends to oversell and undeliver. We all engage it, intentionally or unintentionally. You only have to look as far as Kickstarter where individuals â€œsellâ€ their ideas to an audience they hope will believe in their vision. The temptation to â€œfakeâ€ that vision to appear already created is incredibly high. Temptingly high. So high that Kickstarter began to implement a rule restricting videos involving a â€˜finished productâ€™.</p>

<p>Here we find that even the largest of brands is not above bending the truth and misleading an audience with a deceitful, false impression.</p>

<p>I guess the takeaway is a bit of sadness for the true state of todayâ€™s tech. And an eagerness to see the future evolve.</p>

<p>Oh, and shame on Meta.</p>
