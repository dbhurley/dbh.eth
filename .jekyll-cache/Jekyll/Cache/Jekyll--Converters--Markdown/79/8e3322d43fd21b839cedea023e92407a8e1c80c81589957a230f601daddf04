Oh good, I feel safer already. This news article should really not come as any surprise as the increase and interest in the “metaverse” grows. Inevitably every sector is going to ask that question, “What if…was in the metaverse?”</p>

<p>Everyone’s welcome to ask the question, in fact, asking that kind of question is what I do everyday all day. And I would never discourage anyone from doing so. The important part is what comes after asking the question, listening to the answer.</p>

<p>I’m not going to speak to what form of security and protection we will naturally find in the metaverse setting, but I do find the simple application of a web2 entity to be not quite the full solution and indeed a bit humorous to consider.</p>
