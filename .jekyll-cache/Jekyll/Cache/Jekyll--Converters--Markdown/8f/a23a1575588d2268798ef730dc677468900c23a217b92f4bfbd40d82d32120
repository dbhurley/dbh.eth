Itâ€™s amazing to watch how quickly the UK makes adjustments to political offices. Whereas the political campaigns in the United States can unfold for months and involve all manner of mudslinging and media propaganda, the UK seems to handle the affair over the weekend and be prepared for business as usual by Monday morning.</p>

<p>More interesting, the new incoming Prime Minister has demonstrated a very strong pro-crypto opinion and has pushed for the continued investment in technology and innovationâ€¦like non-fungible tokens and blockchain. #Bullish</p>
