I guess it was inevitable after seeing all the press that Visa has been getting recently for their various crypto initiatives. Today we hear the other behemoth speak up.</p>

<p>Mastercardâ€™s <em>Executive Vice President of Digital Assets and Blockchain Products &amp; Digital Partnerships</em> (guaranteed that job title does not fit on a standard business card) shared their view on what the future of finance looks like with crypto.</p>

<p>He outlines 5 key areas that need to be focused on and offers some work being done in those areas.</p>

<p>While I love seeing existing companies embrace the future and begin to focus their attention on how to be a relevant part of that futureâ€¦I look forward to the future of fintech and our global financial infrastructure.</p>

<p>Who knows, maybe weâ€™re going to all be sporting Mastercard NFTâ€™s in our metaverse wallets.</p>
