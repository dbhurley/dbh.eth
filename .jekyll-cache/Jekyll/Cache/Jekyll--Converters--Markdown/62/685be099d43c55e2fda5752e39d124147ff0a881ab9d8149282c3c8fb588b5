I can’t help but consider history when reading articles like this. I don’t think anyone would disagree with me that NFT artwork can play an important role in preserving cultural artifacts, especially during wartime.</p>

<p>And of course I think of the Nazi regime in Germany, and how they began a process of cultural cleansing, which included destroying or confiscating works of art that they deemed to be degenerate. Many of these works were lost forever. Only a few were able to be saved thanks to the efforts of individuals who smuggled them out of the country.</p>

<p>NFT artwork can help to preserve these cultural artifacts by providing a digital copy that can be shared with the world.</p>

<p>And perhaps even more importantly then the ascribed monetary value to the artwork, the real and true value is in allowing people to learn about the history and culture of a country, even if the physical artifacts have been destroyed.</p>
