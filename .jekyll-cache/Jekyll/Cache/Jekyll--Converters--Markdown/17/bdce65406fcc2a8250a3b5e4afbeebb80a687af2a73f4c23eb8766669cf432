An ETF by another name? This article suggests that major reputable investment firms (Morgan Stanely, etc) are still heavily investing in crypto-based asset classes. Currently ETPs are the “flavor of the month” which represents a vehicle by which individuals can gain access to crypto risk.</p>

<p>Of course it’s only a matter of time I believe before we see an even broader push for a Bitcoin (and others) ETF.</p>

<h3 id="roadblock">Roadblock</h3>
<p>Perhaps the reason for this current roadblock is the fear of the coming <em>flood</em> of new assets seeking similar ETF status.</p>

<h3 id="bottom-line">Bottom line</h3>
<p>Simply put - the wave continues to swell and I believe it’s only a matter of time before we see some major shifts happen.</p>
